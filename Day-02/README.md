# Day 2: Microcontrollers, Sensors, and Welding Practice

---

### Morning Session: Practical Hands-On Welding

Day 2 began with a valuable practical session focused on welding automation, providing deep insight into robot precision and parameter management.

* **Manipulator in Focus:** We gained hands-on experience with the **Panasonic TW 1400WD v||** manipulator, a powerful welding robot used in industrial settings.
* **Robot Laws and Operation:** We observed how the manipulator functions while adhering to the **three laws of robotics** to ensure both safety and precision during complex tasks.
* **Analyzing Welding Defects:** A key learning point was observing common welding defects. We specifically analyzed the defects that occur when an incorrect setting, such as a **large lead at the tip**, is used, highlighting the importance of perfect calibration for quality control.

### Afternoon Session: Theory of Control Systems and Sensing

The focus shifted to the "brains" and "senses" of automationâ€”the crucial electronic and sensing components.

* **Control Systems: Microcontrollers vs. Microprocessors**
    We delved into the core difference between these two components, essential for understanding embedded systems:
    * **Microprocessors (MPUs):** Typically designed for general-purpose computing and multitasking.
    * **Microcontrollers (MCUs):** Designed for specific, dedicated control tasks within embedded systems.

* **Industrial Sensors & Principles**
    We covered the principles and applications of various sensors critical for automated processes:
    * **Proximity Sensors & Inductive Sensors:** Learned how these allow a robot to detect objects without physical contact, with inductive sensors specializing in metallic objects.
    * **Temperature Sensors (PTC & NTC):** Explored both positive (PTC) and negative (NTC) temperature coefficient thermistors.
    * **Vibration Sensors:** Discussed their use in monitoring machine health and enabling predictive maintenance.
    * **Active vs. Passive Sensors:** Learned the fundamental distinction: **Active sensors** require external power to operate (like transmitting a signal), while **Passive sensors** only measure ambient energy (like temperature or light) without generating a signal.
