# Day 1: Introduction to Industrial Robotics and Automation

---

### Morning Session: Theory & Fundamentals

The day began with a comprehensive theoretical session that laid the groundwork for understanding industrial robotics.

* **What is a Robot?**
    The term 'robot' comes from the Czech word 'robota,' which means 'forced work.' A robot is an automatically operated machine designed to reduce human effort and perform tasks without human intervention. Robots are also used for door hacks for better accuracy without any damage. A milestone in robot history: the first articulated robot was developed by Unimation.

* **Robots Anatomy & Joints**
    We explored the fundamental parts of a robot, including the **Manipulator** (the arm with movable joints) and the **End Effector** (the tool at the end of the arm, like a gripper or welder).

* **Types of Industrial Robots**
    * **Cartesian Robot:** A robot that can move in three axes (X, Y, Z).
    * **Cylindrical Robot:** Has two linear movements and one rotational movement.
    * **Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm (SCARA):** A specific type of manipulator with compliance in one axis.
    * **Humanoid Robot:** A robot with a body shape built to resemble a human.
    * **Parallel Robot:** Has multiple arms connected to a single base.
    * **Collaborative Robot (Cobot):** A helpful co-worker that works alongside humans with enhanced safety features.

* **Key Components for Robot Operation**
    * **Teach Pendant:** A remote control used to operate and program the robot.
    * **Controller:** The brain of the robot, housing the computer, power supply, and amplifiers.
    * **Interface:** The connection points for communication between the robot and other devices.
    * **Manipulator:** The arm itself, which moves the end effector.

* **Practical Examples from the Theory Session**
    We discussed **object detection** and its applications in our daily lives, from phone cameras and Snapchat to industrial quality control. We also covered the basics of camera technology, including concepts like resolution, pixels, **Frames per Second (FPS)**, and the color spectrum (400nm to 900nm).

### Afternoon Session: Practical Hands-On Experience

The theory came to life in the afternoon session with hands-on practice.

* **Operating the LR Mate 200iD/7L**

   We had a practical session with a **FANUC LR Mate 200iD/7L** manipulator, using the teach pendant to control it. We learned about its different operational modes: **Teach Pendant mode**, **Programmable mode**, and **Auto mode**. The model name breaks down as:
    * **LR Mate:** Robot Type
    * **200iD:** Version of the mechanical machine
    * **7L:** Payload (7kg) and Long Arm Version

* **Witnessing Spot Welding**
    The highlight of the day was seeing a large industrial manipulator in action. It performed precise **spot welding**, a critical process in automotive manufacturing. We also learned about the various components used in this powerful machine.
