### Morning Session: Theory on Industry 4.0 Pillars

The day began with a comprehensive theoretical session detailing the core concepts that define the Fourth Industrial Revolution, focusing on the future of the "Smart Factory."

* **The 9 Pillars of Industry 4.0:** We covered the nine foundational technologies enabling this revolution:

    1.  **Big Data Analytics:** Using large datasets to optimize production.
    2.  **Cybersecurity:** Protecting connected industrial control systems.
    3.  **Augmented Reality (AR):** Enhancing real-time work instructions and maintenance.
    4.  **Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing):** Enabling flexible, on-demand production.
    5.  **Cloud Computing:** Centralized data storage and decentralized processing power.
    6.  **Autonomous Robots:** Robots that operate independently or collaborate seamlessly with human workers.
    7.  **Digital Twin:** Creating a virtual replica of physical assets for simulation and monitoring.
    8.  **Horizontal & Vertical Integration:** Seamless communication across the entire production value chain.
    9.  **Industrial IoT (IIoT):** Networked smart sensors and smart devices.

### Practical Session: Fluid Power and The 3.0 to 4.0 Leap

We moved from theory to intensive hands-on application, working with fluid power systems and directly comparing automation levels using the JANATICS equipment.

* **Fluid Power Systems (Pneumatics and Hydraulics):**
    * **Pneumatics and Hydraulics Basics:** We performed practical exercises involving **pneumatics** and also connected **hydraulic circuits** to achieve precise **rotation** and **linear motion**.

**Vacuum Technology:** Explored how a vacuum is created and demonstrated its vital industrial applications (e.g., material gripping).

**Electrical Integration:** We successfully implemented both pneumatic and hydraulic systems using electrical control circuits.

**Case Study: The JANATICS Sorting Machine**
    We used a **JANATICS** material sorting machine to clearly illustrate the industrial transition:
  **Industry 3.0 Level:** Observed the machine sorting wood, metal, and rubber items, controlled purely by **PLCs** (a robust example of traditional automation).

  **Industry 4.0 Integration:** The same equipment was then demonstrated with integrated 4.0 technologies:
      **Smart Maintenance:** Used a tablet with **Cloud** and **AR** capabilities to monitor the equipment.
      **Guided Troubleshooting:** If an error occurred, the system would immediately identify the fault and provide a linked **video** (via AR) to guide the technician through the resolution steps, showcasing the power of predictive maintenance.
